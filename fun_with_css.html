                                Batman is the super-hero protector of Gotham City, a man
                                dressed like a bat who fights against evil and strikes
                                terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his
                                secret identity, he assumes the alias of Bruce Wayne,
                                billionaire industrialist and notorious playboy; though
                                "Bruce Wayne" is technically his real name, this Bruce Wayne
                                is a disguise--that of the man he would have been had
                                his parents not been murdered before his eyes when he
                                was no more than a mere boy.

                                While attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe
                                handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials, sponsored
                                by the General Techtronics Corporation, the 15-year-old
                                Peter Parker was bitten on the hand by a spider that had
                                been irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration.
                                Unbeknownst to him, after the spider fell from his hand,
                                it bit a girl, Cindy Moon on the ankle before it died from the
                                radiation. Making his way home afterwards, Peter was almost
                                hit by a car; when Peter jumped out of the way, Peter discovered
                                he had somehow gained incredible strength, agility, and
                                the ability to cling to walls, spider-like traits that he
                                immediately associated with the spider bite.

                                John Constantine is an occult detective and professional 
                                sorcerer from Liverpool, England. His gritty and brutal 
                                attitude makes him recognizable as a cynical, foul-mouthed,
                                chain-smoking anti-hero. Because of his long stint as a Vertigo
                                Universe character, he appeared exclusively in his own series
                                Hellblazer for many years during which he aged in real time.
                                He has been a member of Justice League Dark, the Newcastle
                                Crew and the Trenchcoat Brigade. In addition, he has also acted
                                as a supernatural adviser and ally to the Swamp Thing. John
                                Constantine was created by Alan Moore, Steve Bissette and
                                John Totleben, first appearing in Saga of the Swamp Thing #25.
